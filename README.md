## Coursework of algorithmization and programming

### Task (option 2)

## Graph algorithm - DFS

#### Graph type: 

unweighted undirected, list of edges

#### Graph task: 

For the algorithm specified in the task, when you press the start button, a visualization of the algorithm's operation begins to be drawn. The initial vertex must also be entered if necessary. Visualization means a demonstration of how your algorithm works: which vertices are gray, what is in the queue, which vertex is being inspected right now, which are already black (according to the terminology of the algorithm given to you).

There must also be a “pause” button (stops the simulation), a start button (starts it), and a step back button (rolls the simulation back to the previous step). 

## Data Structure - AVL tree

#### Data Structure task:

The operations of adding, deleting, and searching for an element should be visualized.

## Step-by-step instructions for launching the program

### 1. Clone the repository to your local machine

### 2. Install dependencies

Navigate to the project folder and install the required dependencies using npm or yarn:

```
cd AlgorithmsVisualization
npm install
```

or

```
yarn install
```

If you are having trouble installing dependencies, try using one of these commands if you are using npm:

```
npm install --force
  or
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

or this if you are using yarn:

```
yarn install -- force
```

### 3. Run the start script

Start the development server by running the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

or

```
yarn run dev
```
